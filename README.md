# Digital-Clock

## Goal: 
Design a 3D printable housing and circuitry for a wall powered digital clock. Ensure proper ventilation in the housing, to avoid component overheating, and timing accuracy minimizing any potential sources of drift. 


## Tasks: 
### Completed 
- Circuitry prototype
- Prototype code
- Arduino replica schematic and PCB layout
- Main housing unit with ventilation and LCD screem mounting
  

### To Do 
- Integrate a microcontroller with more accurate timers/counters, or implement a Real Time Clock to improve accuracy and eliminate drift.
- Add PCB mounting to base of housing unit
- Design backing and power adapter mounting
- 3D print housing
- Design circuitry with a voltage regulator to handle voltage from a wall outlet
